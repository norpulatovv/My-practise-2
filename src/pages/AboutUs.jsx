        <p className='text-[26px] text-[black]'>Feed Up is one of the largest fast-food chains in Uzbekistan
          With over 50 locations nationwide and more than 1,000 dedicated team members, we share one mission: to deliver delicious, high-quality, and fast service to every customer, every day.

          The company was founded in 2010 by Umid Irgashev, with the first branch opening in the Algoritm district. Initially, the brand operated under the names “Dastyor” and later “Bisoq.”

          A major transformation took place in 2016 — we underwent a full rebranding, launched a new strategy, defined new goals, and introduced a new name: Feed Up. Since then, we’ve grown into a household name, loved across the country.

          What is Feed Up today?
          Authentic Taste — From juicy burgers and savory doners to flavorful lavash, sandwiches, and hot dogs — plus refreshing cold and hot drinks — we serve the flavors people crave.

          Trusted Quality — We carefully select every ingredient. Our products are sourced from top local and international suppliers, always meeting strict global standards. Freshness, safety, and taste are our top priorities.

          Close to You — We’re expanding every day — not just in the capital, but across the regions of Uzbekistan — to be closer and more accessible to our customers.

          Lightning-Fast Delivery — Orders are prepared quickly and delivered hot. Because your time matters — and great food waits for no one.

          Feed Up is more than just fast food. It’s a national brand infused with Uzbek flavor, growing stronger every day and becoming a beloved part of everyday life.</p>
